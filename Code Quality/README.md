# Clean Code

We find ourselves making stylistic choices in our code quite a bit. But it is important to be consistent in these choices, as an individual developer and as a team. Consistency invokes [the Principle of Least Surprise](https://medium.com/u2i-blogs/how-violating-the-principle-of-least-surprise-can-introduce-subtle-bugs-to-your-code-8902cc51dc29).

> The Principle of Least Surprise (or the Principle of Least Astonishment) is a general design rule which states that your design should match the mental model of your expected audience. In your case, your audience consists of other developers who might have to work with the code you wrote. 

> There's a [great talk by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) about various JavaScript features that don't follow this principle.

**Enjoy that video, then come back.**

JavaScript has a number of such gotchas. It's the reason [Drew Hoover commented](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/12/21/clean-code-full-stack-javascript/):

> Not only is JavaScript the most appropriate language for [a book on clean code] because of its widespread use and promising future, but JavaScript is also a much more difficult language in which to write clean code. 

> Let me be clear: You can write terrible code in any language, but if you were to try to write terrible code that works, JavaScript would be your language of choice.

As developers who work with JavaScript, we must put some discipline into writing clean, quality code.
